# What is a smart zap watch ?

 Will it was an idea which came to my mind when I was again late for my coaching like usual I get lost in my sleep and loses the track of time which , when this idea clicked in my mind . well I had tried multiple methods to avoid this, but nothing worked so the last conclusion was to make a watch which could be somewhat similar to TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) therapy to wake me up very calmly and refreshingly and also could help me get focus when I get distracted .
